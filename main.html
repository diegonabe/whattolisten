        <h1>THE STONE ROSES - THE STONE ROSES (1982)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This is an 80's classic! A cheerful record, with fascinating lyrics that was a brief commercial success, quickly wiped out by the band's vicious internal struggles. They got together again in 2011 to do some concerts and then disappeared.<br>
        But they left this marvelous piece of songs on a par with the best Rolling Stones albums. Each piece sounds one by one, rock and at the same time, lyrically interesting. Let's remember that we are at the beginning of the 80's and the presence of electronic music elements on the radio was becoming more and more frequent. Rock had for a decade and a half more and ended up becoming extinct in 15 years.<br>
        Enjoy.</p>
